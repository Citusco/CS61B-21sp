Static varieble vs non-static varieble
Static:
           You have to use <class>.<methodname or varieble> to call them.
           Before you do that, you don't have to declare a new class(object).
Non-static(instance varieble): 
	You have to use <classname>.<methodname or varieble> to call them.
	Before you do that, you have to declare a new class(object).

this:
	We use 'this' to refer to the current object.
	You can not use 'this' in a static varieble, because when this line of code runs, there is not a object.
e.g.:
public Dog maxDog(Dog d2) {
    if (this.weightInPounds > d2.weightInPounds) {
        return this;
    }
    return d2;
}
Dog d = new Dog(15);
Dog d2 = new Dog(100);
d.maxDog(d2);
